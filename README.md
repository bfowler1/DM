Data Mining, Machine Learning and Visualization Analysis

The four analyses are from datasets of movie reviewers, credit card customers and career postings. The four zip files contain a Jupyter Notebook file(s), HTML file(s) and a data folder containing the files needed to run the Jupyter Notebok.

At the top of the code in each file, is a toggle to activate or deactivate the raw code.
